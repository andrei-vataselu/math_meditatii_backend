# SECURITY AUDIT CHECKLIST (2025-07-28)

### [✔] 1. Rate Limiting

Global rate limiting is present (commented out in app.js). Auth endpoints use per-route limiter. Recommend enabling global limiter in production and stricter limits for /auth, /stripe/webhook.

### [✔] 2. CORS Configuration

CORS is restricted to env variable or localhost. No wildcards. Credentials enabled. Safe if CLIENT_URL is set correctly in prod.

### [✔] 3. Input Sanitization & Validation

Uses express-validator, xss-clean, express-mongo-sanitize, and custom sanitize middleware. All user input is validated and sanitized. Safe, but audit new endpoints periodically.

### [✔] 4. Cookie Security

Cookies set with httpOnly, sameSite: 'strict', and secure (in prod). Cleared on logout/rotation. Safe.

### [✔] 5. Authentication & Authorization

JWT auth enforced on sensitive endpoints. Passwords hashed with bcrypt. No role-based access yet (add if needed). Safe for current use.

### [✔] 6. Error Handling

Error handler hides stack traces in prod. No sensitive info leaked. Safe.

### [✔] 7. Environment Variables & Secrets

.env is in .gitignore. Secrets loaded from env. Rotate secrets regularly. Safe.

### [✔] 8. Logging

Winston logger redacts sensitive info. Console.log disabled in prod. Safe.

### [✔] 9. Security Headers

Helmet used with custom CSP. HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options enabled. Safe.

### [✔] 10. Dependency Security

Dependencies updated, npm audit recommended regularly. Safe.

### [✔] 11. Stripe Webhook Security

Webhook signature verified. Duplicate event prevention. Recommend persisting processed event IDs for high-value events. Safe for most cases.

### [✔] 12. Data Validation

All user input validated with express-validator. Safe.

### [✔] 13. HTTPS Enforcement

Enforced by Google Cloud Run in prod. Recommend redirect HTTP to HTTPS if self-hosted. Safe.

### [✔] 14. Session Management

No session-based auth; JWT only. Safe.

### [✔] 15. File Uploads

No file upload endpoints present. Safe.

### [✔] 16. Third-Party Services

Stripe keys loaded from env, not exposed. Permissions restricted. Safe.

## NEWLY DISCOVERED VULNERABILITIES / RECOMMENDATIONS

- [ ] Stripe webhook processed event IDs are only stored in memory. If server restarts, replay attacks are possible for high-value events. Consider persisting event IDs in DB for critical events.
- [ ] No role-based access control (RBAC) for admin/user separation. Add if needed for future features.
- [ ] No email verification for signup. Add if required for higher trust.
- [ ] No brute-force protection for password reset endpoint (if added). Add rate limiting if implemented.
- [ ] No infrastructure-level monitoring/alerting (e.g. payment failures, login abuse). Set up alerts in prod.

# SECURITY TODO & DEEP ANALYSIS

This document provides a deep security analysis of the Express backend and a prioritized TODO list for hardening the application. Review each item and implement improvements as needed.

---

## 1. Rate Limiting

- **Current State:** Rate limiting is present but commented out.
- **Risks:** Brute force, DoS, API abuse.
- **TODO:**
  - Enable global rate limiting in production.
  - Apply stricter limits to sensitive endpoints (login, password reset).
  - Monitor rate limit logs for abuse patterns.

## 2. CORS Configuration

- **Current State:** CORS is configured with a default origin and credentials.
- **Risks:** Broad origins can allow unwanted cross-origin requests.
- **TODO:**
  - Restrict `origin` to trusted domains in production.
  - Avoid wildcards or broad origins.
  - Review allowed headers and methods for necessity.

## 3. Input Sanitization & Validation

- **Current State:** Custom middleware for sanitization is used.
- **Risks:** Incomplete coverage for XSS, NoSQL injection, and other attacks.
- **TODO:**
  - Audit and test the `sanitize` middleware for effectiveness.
  - Use libraries like `express-validator` for robust validation.
  - Validate all incoming data (body, query, params).

## 4. Cookie Security

- **Current State:** Cookie parser is used, but no explicit security flags.
- **Risks:** Cookie theft, CSRF, session hijacking.
- **TODO:**
  - Set `httpOnly`, `secure`, and `sameSite` flags for all cookies.
  - Use strong secrets for signing cookies.

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

- **Current State:** Not visible in `app.js`, assumed in route middlewares.
- **Risks:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation.
- **TODO:**
  - Ensure all sensitive routes are protected by authentication and authorization.
  - Use strong password hashing (bcrypt, argon2).
  - Implement role-based access control if needed.

## 6. Error Handling

- **Current State:** Custom error handler is present.
- **Risks:** Leaking stack traces or sensitive info.
- **TODO:**
  - Sanitize error responses in production.
  - Log errors securely, avoid logging sensitive data.

## 7. Environment Variables & Secrets

- **Current State:** Uses `.env` for config.
- **Risks:** Secrets exposure, accidental commit.
- **TODO:**
  - Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`.
  - Use environment-specific configs for secrets.
  - Rotate secrets regularly.

## 8. Logging

- **Current State:** Custom logger is used.
- **Risks:** Logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens).
- **TODO:**
  - Scrub sensitive info from logs.
  - Use log rotation and secure storage.

## 9. Security Headers

- **Current State:** Helmet is used with custom CSP.
- **Risks:** Missing headers can expose app to attacks.
- **TODO:**
  - Enable additional headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options).
  - Review and update CSP as needed.

## 10. Dependency Security

- **Current State:** Not visible in `app.js`.
- **Risks:** Vulnerable dependencies.
- **TODO:**
  - Run `npm audit` regularly.
  - Update dependencies promptly.
  - Use tools like `snyk` for automated scanning.

## 11. Stripe Webhook Security

- **Current State:** Raw body parser is used for Stripe webhook.
- **Risks:** Forged webhook requests.
- **TODO:**
  - Verify Stripe webhook signatures.
  - Log and alert on failed verifications.

## 12. Data Validation

- **Current State:** Not explicit in `app.js`.
- **Risks:** Injection, malformed data.
- **TODO:**
  - Use strong validation schemas for all user input.
  - Reject requests with invalid data.

## 13. HTTPS Enforcement

- **Current State:** Not enforced in `app.js`.
- **Risks:** Data interception, MITM attacks.
- **TODO:**
  - Enforce HTTPS in production (redirect HTTP to HTTPS).
  - Set `secure` flag on cookies.

## 14. Session Management

- **Current State:** Not visible in `app.js`.
- **Risks:** Session fixation, hijacking.
- **TODO:**
  - Use secure session management if sessions are used.
  - Set appropriate session expiration and renewal policies.

## 15. File Uploads

- **Current State:** Not visible in `app.js`.
- **Risks:** Malicious files, resource exhaustion.
- **TODO:**
  - Validate and restrict file types and sizes.
  - Store files securely, scan for malware.

## 16. Third-Party Services

- **Current State:** Stripe integration present.
- **Risks:** API key leakage, excessive permissions.
- **TODO:**
  - Restrict API keys and permissions.
  - Store keys securely, rotate regularly.

---

## General Recommendations

- Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests.
- Monitor logs and set up alerts for suspicious activity.
- Educate developers on secure coding practices.
- Document all security policies and procedures.
